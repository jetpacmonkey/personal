Hey! My name is Jeremy Tice, and I'm a web developer, software engineer,
musician, Christian, husband, Yankee fan, father, dad joke enthusiast... person.
Honestly, I'm not sure what the value is of a page like this. I've done some
fun things in my career, which you can find on my
[LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtice), and a bunch of other stuff
in my personal life which I guess you can ask me about through Facebook? Yeah
sure, here's my [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/jetpacmonkey). I also
occasionally put things on [Github](https://www.github.com/jetpacmonkey) and
[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/jetpacmonkey).

Also, this wouldn't truly be a page about me without mentioning my beautiful
wife, Emily, and my son, Benjamin. I love them both very much, and thank God
every day that I get to have them in my life.
