# Brand Spankin' New Website!

## Seriously? Why should I care?

So I've decided to stake my claim before the internet fills up. Because the world needs to know of my opinions and glorious works. So here they are. You can read, you can move on to more talented and interesting people's writings. I'm (probably) going to keep on posting things here, as a log of my thoughts to make it easier to reminisce later, since memory has a tendency to be faulty.

## What to expect

I'm not planning on having any set schedule, but I'll blog about various subjects. The one I have the most "expertise" in would be computer programming, but I'm not going to limit myself to that. I play a few instruments, so if I ever get around to writing music again, I'll post that on here, too. I tend to have fairly strong opinions on baseball and football, as well. Also, if I have any deep thoughts on important topics that feel too civilized to be wasted on the comments section of some other blog, I'll include them as well. Or I'll post lame useless drivel. Whatever.

## OK. Shut up.

Hmm, my fictional version of my readers is kind of rude. I wonder what that says about me... Alright well fine I will. Nothing more to say anyways.
